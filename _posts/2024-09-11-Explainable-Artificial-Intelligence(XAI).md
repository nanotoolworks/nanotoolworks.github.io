The OPENNESS of artificial intelligence is extremely important; although we appreciate the rapidity of black-box results, it is absolutely essential in the realm of science or R&D to be able to understand the *why* behind the *what*. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing AI systems that can provide explanations for their decisions and actions. These explanations help users understand how AI systems arrive at their conclusions, making them more transparent, interpretable, and trustworthy. XAI is crucial for ensuring the accountability, fairness, and safety of AI systems, as well as for enabling human-AI collaboration and decision-making.

Here is a proposed 200-module, year-long post-graduate level intensive curriculum for the underlying theoretical concepts and advanced mathematical statistics algorithms which implement Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI):

Throughout the course, students will engage in hands-on programming exercises and case studies using Jupyter notebooks and polyglot notebooks, leveraging Python numerical libraries and other programming languages such as C and Fortran. The curriculum emphasizes the development of practical skills in implementing and interpreting XAI algorithms, as well as a deep understanding of the theoretical foundations and mathematical concepts underlying these techniques.

By the end of this intensive program, students will have a comprehensive understanding of the current state-of-the-art in XAI, as well as the ability to develop and deploy interpretable and explainable AI systems in various domains. They will be well-equipped to conduct cutting-edge research in the field of XAI and take on leadership roles in industry or academia, driving the development of more transparent, accountable, and trustworthy AI systems.

The course also places a strong emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of XAI, with modules covering topics ranging from cognitive psychology and human reasoning to information visualization and ethical considerations. Through a combination of rigorous coursework, hands-on programming exercises, and independent research projects, this curriculum provides a solid foundation for future leaders and innovators in the field of XAI and its applications to real-world problems.
