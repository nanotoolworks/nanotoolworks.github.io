Working at nanoscale will involve "seeing" things that we are unfamiliar with, but might have similarities to things that we actually are familiar with. Accordingly, we will look at implementing Similarity Learning into our artifical intelligence approach. Similarity Learning is a subfield of machine learning that simply focuses on using AI to machine learn similarity functions from data. These functions are used to measure the similarity between objects in a dataset, which can be useful for tasks such as clustering, classification, and recommendation systems; in other words, AI might not give us exact answers, but it can help sort out the relevant attributes *hidden in plain sight* so that we can sharpen our focus at investigating new phenomena.

Here is a proposed 200-module, year-long post-graduate level intensive curriculum for advanced mathematical statistics tools using Similarity Learning algorithms of artificial intelligence:

Throughout the course, students will engage in a combination of lectures, seminars, problem sets, and programming assignments that cover both the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of similarity learning algorithms. The curriculum emphasizes the development of a deep understanding of the mathematical principles underlying these algorithms, as well as the skills needed to apply them to real-world problems in various domains.

By the end of this intensive program, students will have a comprehensive understanding of the current state-of-the-art in similarity learning, as well as the ability to develop and implement novel algorithms that leverage advanced mathematical concepts such as the Mahalanobis distance, leverage, projection, and measure theory. They will be well-prepared to conduct cutting-edge research in the field of machine learning and take on leadership roles in industry or academia.

The course also places a strong emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of modern machine learning, with modules covering topics ranging from probability theory and linear algebra to graph theory and optimization. Through a combination of rigorous coursework, hands-on programming exercises, and independent research projects, this curriculum provides a solid foundation for future leaders and innovators in the field of similarity learning and its applications to artificial intelligence.
