Here is a proposed 200-module, year-long nanofabrication course for autodidacts, designed to complement Sam Zeloof's AtomicSemi fab venture and the ZeroToASIC course:

Fundamentals (50 modules):
1-10: Introduction to Semiconductors and Devices
11-20: Solid State Physics and Quantum Mechanics
21-30: Crystallography and Materials Science
31-40: Cleanroom Protocols and Safety
41-50: Vacuum Systems and Plasma Physics

Lithography (30 modules):
51-60: Optical Lithography and Photoresists
61-70: Electron Beam Lithography
71-75: Nanoimprint Lithography
76-80: Advanced Lithography Techniques

Thin Film Deposition (30 modules):
81-90: Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)
91-100: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
101-105: Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)
106-110: Electrochemical Deposition

Etching and Patterning (30 modules):
111-120: Wet Chemical Etching
121-130: Dry Etching (RIE, ICP, etc.)
131-135: Lift-off Processes
136-140: Nanoscale Patterning Techniques

Characterization and Metrology (30 modules):
141-150: Optical Microscopy and Spectroscopy
151-160: Electron Microscopy (SEM, TEM)
161-165: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
166-170: Electrical Characterization Techniques

Process Integration and Device Fabrication (30 modules):
171-180: CMOS Process Flow
181-185: MEMS and Sensor Fabrication
186-190: Photonic Device Fabrication
191-195: Quantum Device Fabrication
196-200: Advanced Packaging and 3D Integration

The course begins with a strong foundation in semiconductor physics, materials science, and cleanroom practices. Students will gain hands-on experience with various micro and nanofabrication equipment, including those used in Sam Zeloof's AtomicSemi fab.

Lithography modules cover both conventional and advanced techniques, with an emphasis on electron beam lithography to align with AtomicSemi's capabilities. Thin film deposition and etching modules provide a comprehensive overview of key processes in device fabrication.

Characterization and metrology modules familiarize students with essential tools for analyzing and optimizing fabrication processes. The course culminates with process integration and device fabrication modules, covering a range of application areas.

To complement the ZeroToASIC course, specific modules on CMOS process flow and the use of open-source PDKs and ASIC tools can be included. Students will learn to design and simulate their own ASICs using these resources and gain an understanding of the fabrication process behind them.

Throughout the course, students will work on practical projects that reinforce their learning and develop their skills in nanofabrication. Collaboration with the AtomicSemi fab and the ZeroToASIC community will provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and real-world application of course concepts.

By the end of this comprehensive program, autodidacts will have a strong foundation in nanofabrication and the ability to design and fabricate their own devices using cutting-edge open-source tools and resources.
