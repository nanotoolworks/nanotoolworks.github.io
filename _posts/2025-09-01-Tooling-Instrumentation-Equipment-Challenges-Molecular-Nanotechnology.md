## Tooling, Instrumentation, Equipment Challenges in Molecular Nanotechnology

The nanotechnology sub-field of molecular nanotechnology is a largely theoretical approach to build structures atom by atom, still primarily speculative; from a *tooling* perspective, work in this realm would primarily be about things like simulation [based on lessons learned from other sub-fields of nanotechnology], toolchains for working on computational material science or AI-driven applications and other aspects of assisting theoretical work in the virtual realm.
