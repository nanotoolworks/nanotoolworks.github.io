The course begins with a strong foundation in nanoscale science and technology, covering topics like quantum mechanics, nanomaterials, and characterization techniques. This provides the necessary background for understanding the unique challenges and opportunities at the nanoscale.

The nanofabrication modules dive deep into various techniques and processes used for creating nanoscale structures and devices, including lithography, thin film deposition, etching, and self-assembly. Students will learn the principles and practical applications of each method, as well as strategies for integrating multiple processes.

Nanoscale imaging and metrology modules cover advanced techniques for visualizing and measuring nanoscale features, such as scanning probe microscopy, electron microscopy, and super-resolution optical microscopy. Students will gain hands-on experience with these tools and learn to interpret and analyze the data they generate.

Nanoscale manufacturing and scale-up modules address the challenges of translating nanoscale processes into large-scale production, including quality control, process optimization, and yield management. Students will learn to identify and mitigate defects and variability in nanomanufacturing systems.

The TRIZ methodology modules introduce the 40 Inventive Principles and adapt them to the specific context of nanofabrication and imaging. Students will learn to analyze nanoscale problems and contradictions, and apply TRIZ-inspired solutions to overcome technical barriers and achieve ideal final results.

Case studies and applications modules explore real-world examples of nanoscale technologies in fields like electronics, photonics, medicine, and environmental monitoring. Students will examine how TRIZ principles have been applied to solve complex problems and drive innovation in these areas.

Throughout the course, students will work on projects that involve identifying and solving nanoscale problems using the adapted TRIZ methodology. They will develop skills in problem analysis, solution generation, and experimental validation, with a focus on achieving ideal final results that overcome the limitations of conventional approaches.

By the end of this comprehensive program, students will have a deep understanding of nanofabrication and imaging techniques, as well as a powerful set of tools for inventive problem solving at the nanoscale. They will be well-equipped to contribute to cutting-edge research and development in nanotechnology, and to drive innovation in a wide range of industries and applications.
