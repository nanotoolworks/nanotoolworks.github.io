# Develop Locally, DEPLOY TO THE CLOUD

*Nanotoolworks is fundamentally a knowledge-engineering company. As we see in the electronics industry, it's possible to be deeply engaged in manufacturing engineering and to be 100% completely fabless ... the actual physical equipment is owned by a company dedicated to the business of operating equipment and taking care of facilities ... but the KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING of the product and the manufacturing company is* **entirely separate** 

We have embarked upon a plan to build out of knowledge engineering infrastructure using an API-first, AI-first ML/AI Ops pipeline.

## 1. Introduction

The "develop locally, deploy to cloud" workflow is the most cost-effective approach for ML/AI development, combining the advantages of local hardware control with scalable cloud resources. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing this workflow, specifically tailored to your hardware setup and upgrade considerations.

By properly balancing local and cloud resources, you can:
- Reduce cloud compute costs by up to 70%
- Accelerate development cycles through faster iteration
- Test complex configurations before committing to expensive cloud resources
- Maintain greater control over your development environment
- Scale seamlessly when production-ready

<a id="hardware-optimization"></a>
## 2. Hardware Optimization for Local Development

<a id="current-setup"></a>
### A Typical Current Starting Setup And Assessment

For the sake of discussion, let's say that your current hardware is as follows:
- CPU: 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11700KF @ 3.60GHz (running at 3.50 GHz)
- RAM: 32GB (31.7GB usable) @ 2667 MHz
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 with 10GB VRAM
- OS: Windows 11 with WSL2

This configuration provides a solid *enough* foundation for *really basic* ML/AI development, ie for just *learning the ropes* as a noob. 

Of course, it has specific bottlenecks when working with larger models and datasets *but it's paid for and it's what you have.* {NOTE: Obviously, you can change this story to reflect what you are starting with -- the point is: **DO NOT THROW MONEY AT NEW GEAR.** Use what you have or can cobble together for a few hundred bucks, but *there's NO GOOD REASON to throw thousand$ at this stuff*, ***until you really KNOW what you are doing.***}

<a id="recommended-upgrades"></a>
### Recommended Upgrades

Based on current industry standards and expert recommendations, here are the most cost-effective upgrades for your system:

1. **RAM Upgrade (Highest Priority)**:
   - Increase to 128GB RAM (4×32GB configuration)
   - Target frequency: 3200MHz or higher
   - Estimated cost: ~ $225

2. **Storage Expansion (Medium Priority)**:
   - Add another dedicated 2TB NVMe SSD for ML datasets and model storage
   - Recommended: PCIe 4.0 NVMe with high sequential read/write (>7000/5000 MB/s)
   - Estimated cost: $150-200, *storage always seem to get cheaper, faster, better if you can wait*

3. **GPU Considerations (Optional, Situational)**:
   - Your RTX 3080 with 10GB VRAM is sufficient for most development tasks
   - Only consider upgrading if working extensively with larger vision models or need for multi-GPU testing
   - Cost-effective upgrade would be RTX 4080 Super (16GB VRAM) or RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM)
   - AVOID upgrading GPU if you'll primarily use cloud for large model training

<a id="ram-benefits"></a>
### RAM Upgrade Benefits

Increasing to 128GB RAM provides transformative capabilities for your ML/AI workflow:

1. **Expanded Dataset Processing**:
   - Process much larger datasets entirely in memory
   - Work with datasets that are 3-4× larger than currently possible
   - Reduce preprocessing time by minimizing disk I/O operations

2. **Enhanced Model Development**:
   - Run CPU-offloaded versions of models that exceed your 10GB GPU VRAM
   - Test model architectures up to 70B parameters (quantized) locally
   - Experiment with multiple model variations simultaneously

3. **More Complex Local Testing**:
   - Develop and test multi-model inference pipelines
   - Run memory-intensive vector databases alongside models
   - Maintain system responsiveness during heavy computational tasks

4. **Reduced Cloud Costs**:
   - Complete more development and testing locally before deploying to cloud
   - Better optimize models before cloud deployment
   - Run data validation pipelines locally that would otherwise require cloud resources

<a id="future-proofing"></a>
## 3. Future-Proofing: Alternative Systems & Upgrade Paths

Looking ahead to the next 3-6 months, it's important to consider longer-term hardware strategies that align with emerging ML/AI trends and opportunities. Below are three distinct paths to consider for your future upgrade strategy.

<a id="windows-workstation"></a>
### High-End Windows Workstation Path

The NVIDIA RTX 5090, released in January 2025, represents a significant leap forward for local AI development with its 32GB of GDDR7 memory. This upgrade path focuses on building a powerful Windows workstation around this GPU.

- Alternative: Lease options through NVIDIA partners

<a id="choosing-path"></a>
### Choosing the Right Upgrade Path

Your optimal path depends on several key factors:

**For Windows RTX 5090 Path**:
- **Choose if**: You prioritize raw performance, CUDA compatibility, and hardware flexibility
- **Best for**: Mixed workloads combining AI development, 3D rendering, and traditional compute
- **Timing**: Consider waiting until Q3 2025 for potential price stabilization

**For Apple Silicon Path**:
- **Choose if**: You prioritize development efficiency, memory capacity, and power efficiency
- **Best for**: LLM development, running large models with extensive memory requirements
- **Timing**: Current M3 Ultra is already viable; no urgent need to wait for next generation

**For NVIDIA DGX Path**:
- **Choose if**: You have enterprise budget and need the absolute highest performance
- **Best for**: Organizations developing commercial AI products or research institutions
- **Timing**: Watch for the more accessible DGX Spark option coming in mid-2025

**Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**:
- **Upgrade current system RAM to 128GB NOW**
- Evaluate specific workflow bottlenecks over 3-6 months
- Choose targeted upgrade path based on observed needs rather than specifications
- Consider retaining current system as a secondary development machine after major upgrade
