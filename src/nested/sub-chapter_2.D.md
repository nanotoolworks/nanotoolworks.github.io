# Sub-chapter 2.1 -- Communities For Building a (PAAS) Intelligence Gathering System

Communities require especially ACTIVE intelligence gathering.

The BIG REASON to build a PAAS is to avoid being a mere spectator passively consuming content and to instead actively engage in intelligence gathering ... dogfooding the toolchain and workflow to accomplish this and learning how to do it is an example of what it means to stop being a spectator and actively engage in AI-assisted intelligence gathering.

Being an autodidact will assist you in developing your own best practices, methods, approaches for your own ways of engaging with 50-100 communities that matter. From a time management perspective, your will mostly need to be a hyperefficient lurker.

You cannot fix most stupid comments or cluelessness, so be extremely careful about wading into community discussions. Similarly, you should try not to be the stupid or clueless one *but at some point, you have to take that risk.* If something looks really unclear to you, don't be TOO hesitant to speak up ... just do your homework first AND try to understand the vibe of the community.

**Please** do not expect others to explain every little detail to you. Before you ask questions, you need to assure that you've done everything possible to become familiar with the vibe of the community, ie ***lurk first!!!*** AND it is also up to YOU to make yourself familiar with [pertinent papers](nested/sub-chapter_2.E.md), [relevant documentation](nested/sub-chapter_2.F.md), [trusted or classic technical references](nested/sub-chapter_2.G.md) and [everything about your current options are in the world of computational resources](nested/sub-chapter_2.H.md).

## The (PAAS) Intelligence Gathering System You Build Will Help You Improve Your Community Interactions

**[You will need to dedicate resources to consistently valuable, strengthening tech circles; divest your interest from unstable communities or those in decline or populated with people focused on their rear view mirror; devote effort to strategically identifying emerging technological movements.](https://x.com/i/grok/share/O3HuwbmawRwJJtxvNHOLqZQYb)**

The strategic philosophy at work, "***always be hunting the next game***" means stepping beyond the obviously important essential communities for this learning project. Of course, you will want to devote time to the [HuggingFace forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/), [Rust user forums](https://users.rust-lang.org/), [Tauri Discord](https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/), [Svelte Discord](https://discord.com/channels/457912077277855764), [Learn AI Together Discord](https://discord.com/channels/702624558536065165/@home) and the [top 25 Discord servers devoted to AI engineering and AI ops](https://x.com/i/grok/share/2cBqKftXwSQVMVdr9RuBdyEyj), discussions, wiki and issues on your favorite starred/forked GitHub repositories, [HackerNews for Jobs at YCombinator Startups](https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs), ie to understand what kinds of tech skills are increasing in demand and [YCombinator CoFounder Matching](https://www.startupschool.org/cofounder-matching), ie, a dating app for startup founders tells you something about the health of the startup ecosystem as well as [other startup job boards and founder dating apps or sites/communities that follow this pattern of YCombinator](https://x.com/i/grok/share/I9TTm8YGz4N3VouHLYYbh9Kyz). The [communities behind the process of builing this PAAS intelligence gathering app](https://fartslive.github.io/vision/2025/04/21/communities-for-building-a-PAAS.html) is worthy of a separate post on its own. Consistency is obviously key for following the communities that have formed around existing technologies, but it's also important to always keep branching out in terms of new technologies, exploring / understanding new technologies, finding new emergent communities that spring up around new emergent technologies.

The following content lays out approximately how to level up your community skills game ... obviously, you will want to always be re-strategizing and improving this kind of thing -- but you have to be gathering intelligence from important communities.

### **7. Software Architecture, Deployment & Open Source Communities**

Building a PaaS, even a personal one, requires understanding software architecture patterns, deployment strategies (potentially involving containers, IaC), CI/CD, and potentially engaging with the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem. The evolution of PaaS concepts is increasingly intertwined with the principles of Platform Engineering, often leveraging cloud-native foundations like Kubernetes.

#### **7.1. Architectural Patterns**

41. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Community (Virtual DDD, DDD Europe, dddcommunity.org, Discord/Slack):** DDD provides principles and patterns for tackling complexity in software by focusing on the core business domain and using a ubiquitous language [see ref](#works-cited). Applying DDD concepts (Entities, Value Objects, Bounded Contexts [see ref](#works-cited)) can help structure the multifaceted intelligence gathering application logically. Communities like Virtual DDD (Meetup, Discord, BlueSky) [see ref](#works-cited), DDD Europe (Conference, Mailing List) [see ref](#works-cited), dddcommunity.org [see ref](#works-cited), and specific DDD/CQRS/ES chat groups (e.g., Discord [see ref](#works-cited)) offer resources, discussions, and workshops on applying DDD strategically and tactically. Note that some platforms like Slack are being deprecated in favor of Discord in some DDD communities [see ref](#works-cited).  
42. **Microservices Community (Reddit r/microservices, related blogs/forums):** While potentially overkill for a single-user app initially, understanding microservices architecture is relevant for building a scalable PaaS. The r/microservices subreddit [see ref](#works-cited) hosts discussions on patterns, tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, API Gateways [see ref](#works-cited)), challenges (debugging, data consistency, operational overhead [see ref](#works-cited)), and trade-offs versus monoliths. Monitoring these discussions provides insights into designing, deploying, and managing distributed systems, informing architectural decisions for the PaaS components.

#### **7.2. Platform Engineering & PaaS**

43. **Platform Engineering Community (Slack, Reddit r/platform\_engineering, CNCF TAG App Delivery WG):** Platform Engineering focuses on building internal developer platforms (IDPs) that provide self-service capabilities, often resembling a PaaS [see ref](#works-cited). Understanding its principles, tools, and practices is directly applicable to the user's goal. Communities like the Platform Engineering Slack [see ref](#works-cited) (requires finding current invite link [see ref](#works-cited)), relevant subreddits [see ref](#works-cited), and the CNCF TAG App Delivery's Platforms WG [see ref](#works-cited) (Slack \#wg-platforms, meetings) discuss building platforms, developer experience, automation, and relevant technologies (Kubernetes, IaC).  
44. **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Community (Slack, Mailing Lists, TAGs, KubeCon):** CNCF hosts foundational cloud-native projects like Kubernetes, often used in PaaS implementations. Engaging with the broader CNCF community via Slack [see ref](#works-cited), mailing lists [see ref](#works-cited), Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) like TAG App Delivery [see ref](#works-cited), and events like KubeCon [see ref](#works-cited) provides exposure to cloud-native architecture, container orchestration, observability, and best practices for building and deploying scalable applications. Joining the CNCF Slack requires requesting an invitation [see ref](#works-cited).  
45. **Kubernetes Community (Slack, Forum, GitHub, Meetups):** Kubernetes is the dominant container orchestration platform, often the foundation for PaaS. Understanding Kubernetes concepts is crucial if the user intends to build a scalable or deployable PaaS. The official Kubernetes Slack [see ref](#works-cited) (invite via slack.k8s.io [see ref](#works-cited)), Discourse Forum [see ref](#works-cited), GitHub repo [see ref](#works-cited), and local meetups [see ref](#works-cited) are essential resources for learning, troubleshooting, and connecting with the vast Kubernetes ecosystem. Specific guidelines govern channel creation and usage within the Slack workspace [see ref](#works-cited).

#### **7.3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

46. **Terraform Community (Official Forum, GitHub):** Terraform is a leading IaC tool for provisioning and managing infrastructure across various cloud providers using declarative configuration files [see ref](#works-cited). It's essential for automating the setup of the infrastructure underlying the PaaS. The official HashiCorp Community Forum [see ref](#works-cited) and GitHub issue tracker [see ref](#works-cited) are primary places to ask questions, find use cases, discuss providers, and learn best practices for managing infrastructure reliably and repeatably via code.  
47. **Pulumi Community (Slack, GitHub):** Pulumi is an alternative IaC tool that allows defining infrastructure using general-purpose programming languages like Python, TypeScript, Go, etc [see ref](#works-cited). This might appeal to the user given their developer background and desire to leverage programming skills. The Pulumi Community Slack and GitHub [see ref](#works-cited) offer support and discussion around defining infrastructure programmatically, managing state, and integrating with CI/CD pipelines, providing a different, code-centric approach to IaC compared to Terraform's declarative model.

#### **7.4. CI/CD & General GitHub**

48. **GitHub Actions Community (via GitHub Community Forum):** GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform integrated directly into GitHub, used for automating builds, tests, and deployments [see ref](#works-cited). It's crucial for automating the development lifecycle of the PaaS application. Discussions related to Actions, including creating custom actions [see ref](#works-cited) and sharing workflows, likely occur within the broader GitHub Community Forum [see ref](#works-cited), where users share best practices for CI/CD automation within the GitHub ecosystem.  
49. **GitHub Community Forum / Discussions (General):** Beyond specific features like Actions or project-specific Discussions, the main GitHub Community Forum [see ref](#works-cited) and the concept of GitHub Discussions [see ref](#works-cited) - often enabled per-repo, like Discourse [see ref](#works-cited)) serve as general platforms for developer collaboration, Q\&A, and community building around code. Understanding how to effectively use these platforms (asking questions, sharing ideas, participating in polls [see ref](#works-cited)) is a meta-skill beneficial for engaging with almost any open-source project or community hosted on GitHub.

#### **7.5. Open Source Software (OSS) Practices**

The maturation of open source involves moving beyond individual contributions towards more structured organizational participation and strategy, as seen in groups like TODO and FINOS. Understanding these perspectives is increasingly important even for individual developers.

50. **TODO Group (Mailing List, Slack, GitHub Discussions):** The TODO (Talk Openly, Develop Openly) Group is a community focused on practices for running effective Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) and open source initiatives [see ref](#works-cited). Engaging with their resources (guides, talks, surveys [see ref](#works-cited)) and community (Mailing List [see ref](#works-cited), Slack [see ref](#works-cited), GitHub Discussions [see ref](#works-cited), Newsletter Archives [see ref](#works-cited)) provides insights into OSS governance, contribution strategies ("upstream first" [see ref](#works-cited)), licensing, and community building [see ref](#works-cited), valuable if considering open-sourcing parts of the project or contributing back to dependencies.
