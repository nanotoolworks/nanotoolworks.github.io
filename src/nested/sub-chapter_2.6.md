# Chapter 2 -- The 50-Day Plan For Building A Personal Assistant Agentic System (PAAS)

## PHASE 2: API INTEGRATIONS (Days 11-25)

In this phase, you'll build the data collection foundation of your PAAS by implementing integrations with all your target information sources. Each integration will follow a similar pattern: first understanding the API and data structure, then implementing core functionality, and finally optimizing and extending the integration. You'll apply the foundational patterns established in Phase 1 while adapting to the unique characteristics of each source. By the end of this phase, your system will be able to collect data from all major research, code, patent, and financial news sources.

### Day 11-13: GitHub Integration & Jujutsu Basics

In these three days, you will focus on developing a **comprehensive** GitHub integration to monitor the open-source code ecosystem, while also learning and **using** Jujutsu as a modern distributed version control system to track your own development. You'll create systems to track trending repositories, popular developers, and emerging projects in the AI and machine learning space. You'll learn how Jujutsu's advanced branching and history editing capabilities can improve your development workflow compared to traditional Git. You'll build analysis components to identify meaningful signals within the vast amount of GitHub activity, separating significant developments from routine updates. You'll also develop methods to link GitHub projects with related research papers and other external resources.

- **Morning (3h)**: Learn GitHub API and Jujutsu fundamentals
  - Repository events and Jujutsu introduction: Master GitHub's Events API to monitor activities like pushes, pull requests, and releases across repositories of interest while learning the fundamentals of Jujutsu as a modern alternative to Git. Compare Jujutsu's approach to branching, merging, and history editing with traditional Git workflows, understanding how Jujutsu's Rust implementation provides performance benefits for large repositories.
  - Search capabilities: Explore GitHub's search API functionality to identify repositories based on topics, languages, and stars while studying how Jujutsu's advanced features like first-class conflicts and revsets can simplify complex development workflows. Learn how Jujutsu's approach to tracking changes can inspire your own system for monitoring repository evolution over time.
  - Trending repositories analysis and Jujutsu for project management: Study methods for analyzing trending repositories while experimenting with Jujutsu for tracking your own PAAS development. Understand how Jujutsu's immutable history model and advanced branching can help you maintain clean feature branches while still allowing experimentation, providing a workflow that could be incorporated into your intelligence gathering system.

- **Afternoon (3h)**: Build GitHub monitoring system with Jujutsu integration
  - Track repository stars and forks: Implement tracking systems that monitor stars, forks, and watchers for repositories of interest, detecting unusual growth patterns that might indicate important new developments. Structure your own project using Jujutsu for version control, creating a branching strategy that allows parallel development of different components.
  - Monitor code commits and issues: Build components that analyze commit patterns and issue discussions to identify active development areas in key projects, using Rust for efficient processing of large volumes of GitHub data. Experiment with Jujutsu's advanced features for managing your own development branches, understanding how its design principles could be applied to analyzing repository histories in your monitoring system.
  - Analyze trending repositories: Create analytics tools that can process repository metadata, README content, and code statistics to identify the purpose and significance of trending repositories. Implement a Rust-based component that can efficiently process large repository data while organizing your code using Jujutsu's workflow to maintain clean feature boundaries between different PAAS components.
