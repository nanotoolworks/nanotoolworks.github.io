# Chapter 2 -- The 50-Day Plan For Building A Personal Assistant Agentic System (PAAS)

## PHASE 3: ADVANCED AGENT CAPABILITIES (Days 26-40)

### Day 29-31: Google A2A Protocol Integration

These three days will focus on integrating with Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling your PAAS to communicate with Google's AI agents and other systems implementing this standard. You'll learn how A2A works, understanding its message structure, capability negotiation, and interoperability features. You'll develop Rust components that implement the A2A specification, creating a bridge between your system and the broader A2A ecosystem. You'll also explore how to combine A2A with Anthropic's MCP, enabling your system to leverage the strengths of different AI models and protocols. Throughout, you'll maintain a focus on security and reliability using Rust's strong guarantees.

- **Morning (3h)**: Learn Google's Agent-to-Agent protocol
  - A2A specification: Study the details of Google's A2A protocol, including its message format, interaction patterns, and standard capabilities that define how agents communicate. Create Rust data structures that accurately represent A2A messages with proper validation, using Rust's type system to ensure protocol compliance at compile time.
  - Interoperability standards: Understand how A2A enables interoperability between different agent systems, including capability discovery, message translation, and cross-protocol bridging. Develop mapping functions in Rust that can translate between your internal representations and the standardized A2A formats, ensuring consistent behavior across different systems.
  - Capability negotiation: Learn how capability negotiation works in A2A, allowing agents to communicate what tasks they can perform and what information they require. Implement Rust traits that define clear interfaces for capabilities, creating a type-safe system for capability matching between your agents and external systems.

- **Afternoon (3h)**: Implement Google A2A with Rust
  - Set up Google AI integration: Build a robust Rust client for Google's AI services that handles authentication, request formation, and response parsing with proper error handling. Implement connection management, retry logic, and rate limiting using Rust's strong typing to prevent runtime errors in API interactions.
  - Build A2A message handlers: Create message processing components in Rust that can parse incoming A2A messages, route them to appropriate handlers, and generate valid responses. Develop a middleware architecture using Rust traits that allows for modular message processing while maintaining type safety throughout the pipeline.
  - Test inter-agent communication: Implement testing frameworks that verify your A2A implementation interoperates correctly with other agent systems. Create simulation environments in Rust that can emulate different agent behaviors, enabling comprehensive testing of communication patterns without requiring constant external API calls.
