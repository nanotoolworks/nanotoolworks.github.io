# Chapter 2 -- The 50-Day Plan For Building A Personal Assistant Agentic System (PAAS)

## PHASE 4: SYSTEM INTEGRATION & POLISH (Days 41-50)

### Day 47-48: Tauri/Svelte Dashboard & Interface

These two days focus on creating a polished, responsive user interface for your PAAS using Tauri with Svelte frontend technology. You'll design an intuitive dashboard that presents intelligence insights clearly while providing powerful customization options. You'll implement efficient data visualization components that leverage Rust's performance while providing reactive updates through Svelte. You'll create notification systems that alert users to important developments in real-time. You'll also ensure your interface is accessible across different platforms while maintaining consistent performance and security.

- **Morning (3h)**: Learn dashboard design principles with Tauri and Svelte
  - Information visualization with Svelte components: Study effective information visualization approaches for intelligence dashboards while learning how Svelte's reactivity model enables efficient UI updates without virtual DOM overhead. Explore Svelte visualization libraries like svelte-chartjs and d3-svelte that can be integrated with Tauri to create performant data visualizations backed by Rust data processing.
  - User interaction patterns with Tauri/Svelte architecture: Learn best practices for dashboard interaction design while understanding the unique architecture of Tauri applications that combine Rust backend processing with Svelte frontend rendering. Study how to structure your application to minimize frontend/backend communication overhead while maintaining a responsive user experience.
  - Alert and notification systems with Rust backend: Explore notification design patterns while learning how Tauri's Rust backend can perform continuous monitoring and push updates to the Svelte frontend using efficient IPC mechanisms. Understand how to leverage system-level notifications through Tauri's APIs while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

- **Afternoon (3h)**: Build user interface with Tauri and Svelte
  - Create summary dashboard with Svelte components: Implement a main dashboard using Svelte's component model for efficient updates, showing key intelligence insights with minimal latency. Design reusable visualization components that can render different data types while maintaining consistent styling and interaction patterns.
  - Implement notification system with Tauri/Rust backend: Build a real-time notification system using Rust background processes to monitor for significant developments, with Tauri's IPC bridge pushing updates to the Svelte frontend. Create priority levels for notifications and allow users to customize alert thresholds for different information categories.
  - Build report configuration tools with type-safe Rust/Svelte communication: Develop interfaces for users to customize intelligence reports, filter criteria, and display preferences using Svelte's form handling with type-safe validation through Rust. Implement Tauri commands that expose Rust functions to the Svelte frontend, ensuring consistent data validation between frontend and backend components.
