# Chapter 2 -- The 50-Day Plan For Building A Personal Assistant Agentic System (PAAS)
### Daily Resources Augment The Program Of Study With Serindiptious Learning

- **Documentation Awaremess**: Implement and improve your methodical speedreading discipline to efficiently process and develop the most basic, but extensive awareness of technical documentation across foundational technologies: [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs), [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/docs), [RunPod](https://docs.runpod.io/), [VAST AI](https://vast.ai/docs/), [ThunderCompute](https://docs.thundercompute.com/), [MCP](https://mcp.docs.gpu.co/), [A2A](https://docs.a2a.ai/), [Tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/), [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs/introduction), [Jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/), and additional relevant technologies encountered during development. Enhance your documentation processing or speedreading capacity through deliberate practice and progressive exposure to complex technical content. While AI assistants provide valuable support in locating specific information, developing a comprehensive mental model of these technological ecosystems enables you to craft more effective queries and better contextualize AI-generated responses.
