### It's up to YOU to manage your day. OWN IT!

**THIS IS MEETING FREE ZONE.**

You're an adult. OWN your workflow and time mgmt. This recommended workflow is fundamentally only a high-agency workflow TEMPLATE for self-starters and people intent on improving their autodidactic training discipline. 

Calling it a TEMPLATE means that you can come up with better. So DO!

There's not going to be a teacher to babysit the low-agency slugs who require a classroom environment ... if you can't keep up with the schedule, that's up to you to either change the schedule or up your effort/focus. 

**There's no rulekeeper or set of Karens on the webconf or Zoom call monitoring your discipline and ability to stay focused, sitting in your comfortable chair and not drift off to porn sites so you start jacking off ... like you are some sort of low-agency loser masturbating your life full of pointless meetings.**
