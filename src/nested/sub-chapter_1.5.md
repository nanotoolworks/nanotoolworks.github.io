#### Graph Database Implementation

GitButler's knowledge representation relies on a sophisticated graph database infrastructure:

- **Knowledge Graph Schema**:
  - Entities: Files, functions, classes, developers, commits, issues, concepts
  - Relationships: Depends-on, authored-by, references, similar-to, evolved-from
  - Properties: Timestamps, metrics, confidence levels, relevance scores
  - Hyperedges: Complex relationships involving multiple entities
  - Temporal dimensions: Valid-time and transaction-time versioning

- **Graph Storage Technology Selection**:
  - Neo4j for rich query capabilities and pattern matching
  - DGraph for GraphQL interface and horizontal scaling
  - TigerGraph for deep link analytics and parallel processing
  - JanusGraph for integration with Hadoop ecosystem
  - Neptune for AWS integration in cloud deployments

- **Query Language Approach**:
  - Cypher for pattern-matching queries
  - GraphQL for API-driven access
  - SPARQL for semantic queries
  - Gremlin for imperative traversals
  - SQL extensions for relational developers

- **Scaling Strategy**:
  - Sharding by relationship locality
  - Replication for read scaling
  - Caching of frequent traversal paths
  - Partitioning by domain boundaries
  - Federation across multiple graph instances

Implementation specifics include:
- Custom graph serialization formats for efficient storage
- Change Data Capture (CDC) for incremental updates
- Bidirectional synchronization with vector and document stores
- Graph compression techniques for storage efficiency
- Custom traversal optimizers for GitButler-specific patterns

#### Ontology Development

A formal ontology provides structure for the knowledge representation:

- **Domain Ontologies**:
  - Code Structure Ontology: Classes, methods, modules, dependencies
  - Git Workflow Ontology: Branches, commits, merges, conflicts
  - Developer Activity Ontology: Actions, intentions, patterns, preferences
  - Issue Management Ontology: Bugs, features, statuses, priorities
  - Concept Ontology: Programming concepts, design patterns, algorithms

- **Ontology Formalization**:
  - OWL (Web Ontology Language) for formal semantics
  - RDF Schema for basic class hierarchies
  - SKOS for concept hierarchies and relationships
  - SHACL for validation constraints
  - Custom extensions for development-specific concepts

- **Ontology Evolution**:
  - Version control for ontology changes
  - Compatibility layers for backward compatibility
  - Inference rules for derived relationships
  - Extension mechanisms for domain-specific additions
  - Mapping to external ontologies (e.g., Schema.org, SPDX)

- **Multi-Level Modeling**:
  - Core ontology for universal concepts
  - Language-specific extensions (Python, JavaScript, Rust)
  - Domain-specific extensions (web development, data science)
  - Team-specific customizations
  - Project-specific concepts

Implementation approaches include:
- Protégé for ontology development and visualization
- Apache Jena for RDF processing and reasoning
- OWL API for programmatic ontology manipulation
- SPARQL endpoints for semantic queries
- Ontology alignment tools for ecosystem integration
