<li><strong>Rust-Based Data Processing</strong>: By this point will have encountered, experimented with and maybe even began to implement efficient data processing pipelines in your Rust/Tauri/Svelte client [forked from GitButler] that can handle the specific formats and structures of each data source, with optimized memory usage and concurrent processing where appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Agent Architecture Design</strong>: You should have designed the high-level architecture for your PAAS, defining component boundaries, data flows, and coordination mechanisms between specialized agents that will handle different aspects of intelligence gathering.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Source Entity Resolution</strong>: You should have implemented entity resolution systems that can identify the same people, organizations, and technologies across different data sources, creating a unified view of the AI landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Data Validation and Quality Control</strong>: You should have implemented validation systems for each data source that ensure the consistency and reliability of collected information, with error detection and recovery mechanisms for handling problematic data.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="phase-3-advanced-agentic-capabilities-through-rust-orchestration-end-of-week-8"><a class="header" href="#phase-3-advanced-agentic-capabilities-through-rust-orchestration-end-of-week-8">Phase 3: Advanced Agentic Capabilities Through Rust Orchestration (End of Week 8)</a></h3>
<p>As we see above, by the end of your fifth week, you will have something to build upon. From week six on, you will build upon the core agentic capabilities of your system and add advanced agentic capabilities, including orchestration, summarization, and interoperability with other more complex AI systems. The milestones of this third phase will ensures your PAAS can process, sift, sort, prioritize and make sense of the especially vast amounts of information that it is connected to from a variety of different sources. It might yet be polished or reliable at the end of week 8, but you will have something that is close enough to working well, that you can enter the homestretch refining your PAAS.</p>
<p><strong>Key Competencies:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Anthropic MCP Integration</strong>: You should have built a complete integration with Anthropic's MCP that enables sophisticated interactions with Claude and other Anthropic models, leveraging their capabilities for information analysis and summarization.</li>
<li><strong>Google A2A Protocol Support</strong>: You should have implemented support for Google's A2A protocol, enabling your PAAS to communicate with Google's AI agents and other systems implementing this standard for expanded capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Rust-Based Agent Orchestration</strong>: You should have created a robust orchestration system in Rust that can coordinate multiple specialized agents, with efficient task scheduling, message routing, and failure recovery mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Source Summarization</strong>: You should have implemented advanced summarization capabilities that can synthesize information across different sources, identifying key trends, breakthroughs, and connections that might not be obvious from individual documents.</li>
<li><strong>User Preference Learning</strong>: You should have built systems that can learn and adapt to your preferences over time, prioritizing the most relevant information based on your feedback and behavior patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Type-Safe Agent Communication</strong>: You should have established type-safe communication protocols between different agent components, leveraging Rust's strong type system to prevent errors in message passing and task definition.</li>

<p>In this last phase, you will be polishing and improving the reliability what was basically a functional PAAS, but still had issues, bugs or components that needed overhaul. In the last phase, you will be refining of what were some solid beginnings of an intuitive Tauri/Svelte user interface. In this final phase, you will look at different ways to improve upon the robustness of data storage and to improve the efficacy of your comprehensive monitoring and testing. This milestone represents the completion of your basic system, which might still not be perfect, but it should be pretty much ready for use and certainly ready for future ongoing refinement and continued extensions and simplifications.</p>
