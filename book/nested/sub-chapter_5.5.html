<p>This post examines strategies for scaling ML infrastructure from initial local development through growing cloud deployment as projects mature from experimental prototypes to production systems. It explores infrastructure evolution patterns that accommodate increasing data volumes, model complexity, and reliability requirements without requiring complete reimplementation at each growth stage. The post details technical approaches for implementing scalable architecture patterns, selecting appropriate infrastructure components for different growth stages, and planning migration paths that minimize disruption as scale increases. It provides guidance on identifying scaling triggers, planning appropriate infrastructure expansions, and managing transitions between infrastructure tiers. This scalable infrastructure approach ensures early development can proceed efficiently on local resources while providing clear pathways to cloud deployment as projects demonstrate value and require additional scale, preventing the need for complete rewrites when moving from experimentation to production deployment.</p>
