<p>The nanotechnology sub-field of nanotoxicology examines the potential toxic effects of nanomaterials, especially for monitoring, addressing, mitigating safety concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The rapid expansion of nanotechnology has introduced a diverse array of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) into various sectors, including medicine, electronics, consumer products, and environmental remediation.1 This proliferation promises significant technological and economic benefits but concurrently raises concerns regarding potential risks to human health and the environment.1 Nanotoxicology, the field dedicated to assessing these risks, faces unique challenges stemming from the distinct physicochemical properties of materials at the nanoscale (typically 1-100 nm).7 Unlike their bulk chemical counterparts, ENMs exhibit properties such as high surface area-to-volume ratios, quantum effects, and unique surface reactivities, which govern their interactions with biological systems in complex ways.7 Consequently, traditional toxicological assessment methods often prove inadequate or yield unreliable results when applied to ENMs.13</p>
<p>Ensuring the safe and sustainable development of nanotechnology necessitates robust and reliable methods for characterizing ENMs, quantifying exposure, and evaluating potential hazards.16 However, significant gaps exist in the available tooling, instrumentation, and methodologies required for comprehensive safety assessment.5 These limitations hinder the ability to generate consistent, comparable data, establish clear structure-activity relationships, perform accurate risk assessments, and develop harmonized regulatory guidelines.1 The dire need for improved assessment capabilities is underscored by the limited exploitation of potentially beneficial nanotechnologies due to safety uncertainties 16 and the historical precedents where initially promising materials later revealed significant hazards.2</p>
<p>This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most significant technical barriers currently impeding nanotoxicology safety assessment. Drawing upon recent scientific literature and expert opinions, it identifies and elaborates on up to 100 specific tooling, instrumentation, and methodological quandaries. These challenges are broadly categorized into issues related to ENM characterization, dosimetry and exposure quantification, assessment of biological effects, and methodological standardization and predictive modeling. By detailing these persistent problems and their underlying causes, this report seeks to illuminate the critical areas requiring innovation and investment to advance the field and support the responsible integration of nanotechnology into society.</p>
<p><strong>Section 1: Barriers in Nanomaterial Characterization for Toxicological Assessment</strong></p>
<p>Comprehensive physicochemical characterization forms the bedrock of any meaningful nanotoxicological investigation.11 Understanding properties like size, shape, surface chemistry, and stability is crucial because these parameters dictate how an ENM interacts with biological components, influencing its uptake, distribution, persistence, and ultimate toxic potential.12 However, a major hurdle lies in performing this characterization under conditions relevant to biological or environmental exposure.1 ENMs are not static entities; they undergo dynamic transformations (e.g., aggregation, dissolution, protein corona formation) upon contact with complex media, meaning their properties <em>in situ</em> or <em>in vivo</em> can differ dramatically from those measured in pristine conditions.4 Many current analytical tools struggle to cope with the complexities of biological matrices and the dynamic nature of ENMs, leading to significant uncertainties in linking specific material properties to observed biological effects.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Challenges in Size and Size Distribution Measurement</strong></p>
<p>Accurately determining the size and size distribution of ENMs within relevant biological or environmental media remains a fundamental challenge. Techniques commonly employed, such as Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), face significant limitations when applied outside of simple, clean systems.21 DLS, which measures hydrodynamic size based on light scattering fluctuations, struggles with polydisperse samples (common for ENMs), interference from matrix components (proteins, salts), and low ENM concentrations.16 TEM provides high-resolution images but requires extensive sample preparation (drying, staining, vacuum) that can introduce artifacts like aggregation or alter particle structure, and it offers only static snapshots of potentially dynamic systems, often requiring laborious analysis for statistical relevance.21</p>
<p>Furthermore, distinguishing between the primary size of individual nanoparticles, the size of aggregates (strongly bound clusters), and agglomerates (loosely bound clusters) <em>in situ</em> is difficult yet critical, as these different forms can exhibit distinct biological behaviors and toxicities.16 Current methodologies often lack the capability for real-time, <em>in situ</em> monitoring of size changes during exposure experiments. This inability to track size dynamics accurately within the exposure environment represents a major bottleneck, given that particle size significantly influences cellular uptake mechanisms, translocation across barriers, biodistribution patterns, and clearance rates.11 Without tools to measure the relevant size metric (primary vs. aggregate/agglomerate) dynamically in the relevant environment, understanding these critical size-dependent biological processes is severely hampered.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Challenges in Shape and Morphology Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Nanomaterial shape is another critical determinant of biological interaction, influencing processes like cellular uptake, phagocytosis rates, and inflammatory responses.20 For instance, high-aspect-ratio nanomaterials (HARN), such as carbon nanotubes or nanofibers 2, often elicit different biological responses compared to spherical particles of similar composition and volume. However, quantitatively characterizing complex morphologies, especially within biological or environmental matrices, remains challenging.</p>
<p>Imaging techniques like TEM and SEM can visualize shape but face difficulties in providing statistically robust, quantitative shape descriptors (e.g., aspect ratio, sphericity, surface curvature) for large particle populations <em>in situ</em> without time-consuming manual analysis or sophisticated image analysis algorithms that are not yet standardized.24 Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus on which specific shape metrics are most relevant for predicting biological interactions and a corresponding lack of standardized methods to measure these parameters reliably and efficiently.20 This hinders the development of clear shape-activity relationships.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Challenges in Surface Chemistry and Charge Characterization</strong></p>
<p>The surface of an ENM is its primary interface with the biological world, making surface chemistry (composition, functional groups, coatings, defects) and surface charge critical factors in determining interactions with cells and biomolecules.7 However, characterizing these surface properties <em>in situ</em> is exceptionally difficult because surfaces are highly susceptible to modification upon contact with biological fluids (e.g., adsorption of proteins forming a corona, binding of ions). Techniques like X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) or Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), which provide detailed surface chemical information, typically require high vacuum conditions and are not readily applicable to hydrated, complex biological samples.</p>
<p>Measuring surface charge, often represented by the zeta potential, is also problematic in physiologically relevant media.16 Biological fluids typically have high ionic strength, which screens surface charges and compresses the electrical double layer, making zeta potential measurements difficult to perform and interpret reliably. Measurements are often conducted in simplified, low-ionic-strength buffers, which may not accurately reflect the effective surface charge experienced by the ENM <em>in vivo</em> or <em>in vitro</em> in complex culture media. This lack of tools for relevant surface characterization limits the understanding of how surface properties drive biological responses.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 Challenges in Assessing Dynamic Transformations (Aggregation, Dissolution, Corona Formation)</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the most pervasive challenge in ENM characterization for nanotoxicology stems from their dynamic nature in biological and environmental systems. ENMs rarely remain in their pristine, as-synthesized state upon introduction into complex media. They can aggregate or agglomerate, changing their effective size and surface area 16; they can dissolve, releasing potentially toxic ions 7; and they rapidly adsorb proteins and other biomolecules to form a "corona" that dictates their biological identity.4 Assessing these transformations dynamically and <em>in situ</em> is crucial but technically demanding.</p>
<p>Robust tools for monitoring aggregation/agglomeration kinetics in real-time under relevant exposure conditions are lacking, yet the aggregation state significantly impacts dosimetry, transport, and biological activity. Similarly, accurately measuring dissolution rates and distinguishing between toxicity caused by the particles themselves versus the released ions is difficult, especially for complex multicomponent ENMs or within complex biological matrices where ions may already be present or interact with matrix components.23 Techniques like single-particle ICP-MS (sp-ICP-MS) show promise for differentiating dissolved ions from particles but require further development, validation, and wider accessibility.26 Characterizing the dynamically evolving biomolecule corona <em>in situ</em> is also challenging; current methods often involve isolating the ENM-corona complex, which may perturb the corona structure and composition.21 This fundamental mismatch between the dynamic reality of nano-bio interactions and the predominantly static capabilities of many characterization tools hinders progress in understanding mechanisms and predicting effects.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 Challenges in Distinguishing Engineered vs. Background Nanoparticles</strong></p>
<p>For realistic exposure assessment, particularly in environmental or occupational settings, it is essential to distinguish target ENMs from naturally occurring or incidentally produced nanoparticles (e.g., from combustion or weathering) that may be present at much higher concentrations.1 Many ENMs lack unique analytical signatures, making their specific detection and quantification in complex mixtures extremely challenging. This requires the development and application of highly sensitive and specific analytical techniques, such as advanced mass spectrometry methods (e.g., ICP-MS coupled with separation techniques, isotope labeling) or specific functionalization/labeling strategies. However, such sophisticated methods are often complex, expensive, and not readily available for routine monitoring, limiting the ability to accurately assess real-world ENM exposures.17</p>
<p><strong>Section 2: Barriers in Dosimetry and Exposure Quantification</strong></p>
<p>Accurate dosimetry—the measurement or estimation of the dose of a substance received by a biological system—is fundamental to toxicology. It allows for the establishment of quantitative dose-response relationships, informs risk assessment, and is essential for extrapolating findings between experimental systems (e.g., <em>in vitro</em> to <em>in vivo</em>).5 For ENMs, however, dosimetry presents unique and significant challenges that go beyond those encountered with soluble chemicals.7 Issues arise from the particulate nature of the dose, complex delivery dynamics (e.g., sedimentation, diffusion, aggregation), difficulties in defining the most relevant dose metric, and challenges in measuring the dose that actually reaches the target site (the biologically effective dose).</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Defining Relevant Dose Metrics</strong></p>
<p>A primary challenge is the lack of consensus on the most appropriate dose metric for expressing ENM exposure and predicting biological effects.11 While mass concentration (e.g., µg/mL or µg/cm²) is the most commonly reported metric due to ease of measurement and convention, it may not be the most biologically relevant parameter for nanoparticles. Other metrics, such as particle number concentration, total surface area, surface reactivity, or even the number of specific surface sites, might be better predictors of toxicity for certain ENMs and endpoints, as toxicity is often driven by surface interactions.11</p>
<p>However, measuring these alternative metrics accurately and routinely, especially <em>in situ</em> or <em>in vivo</em>, poses significant technical difficulties. Furthermore, the most relevant dose metric might not be constant; it could vary depending on the ENM type, the biological system, the exposure route, the endpoint measured, and even the transformation state of the ENM within the biological compartment.12 This ambiguity complicates the comparison of results across studies and hinders the development of predictive models and regulatory guidelines. Resolving this requires not only developing tools to measure various metrics but also systematic research to determine which metric(s) best correlate with biological outcomes for different scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Quantifying Delivered Dose <em>In Vitro</em></strong></p>
<p>In <em>in vitro</em> cell-based assays, quantifying the dose of ENMs that actually reaches and interacts with the cells is notoriously difficult.21 Unlike soluble chemicals that distribute relatively uniformly in culture media, ENMs are subject to complex transport phenomena, including sedimentation (gravitational settling), diffusion, and aggregation/agglomeration, all influenced by particle properties (size, density, surface charge) and media composition (viscosity, ionic strength, protein content). Consequently, the nominal concentration added to the media often bears little resemblance to the concentration at the cell surface over time.</p>
<p>While computational models (e.g., based on distorted grid or particle-dynamics approaches) have been developed to estimate the delivered dose, they require accurate input parameters (e.g., effective particle density, agglomeration state in media) that are often difficult to measure or unavailable.21 There is a lack of standardized, validated, and easy-to-use tools for real-time monitoring of ENM concentration and state (e.g., size distribution, aggregation) directly at the cell-culture interface during exposure. Furthermore, quantifying the <em>internalized</em> dose (e.g., number or mass of particles per cell) remains challenging, especially for large cell populations needed for statistical power.24 Techniques like flow cytometry can measure cell-associated fluorescence (if particles are labeled) but require careful calibration against lower-throughput, high-resolution methods like electron microscopy to translate fluorescence intensity into particle number or mass per cell.24 This persistent uncertainty in <em>in vitro</em> dosimetry is a major factor contributing to the unreliability of <em>in vitro</em> data and the difficulty in extrapolating findings to <em>in vivo</em> situations.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Quantifying Dose and Biodistribution <em>In Vivo</em></strong></p>
<p>Determining the fate of ENMs within a whole organism (<em>in vivo</em>) presents another set of significant challenges. Non-invasive imaging techniques (e.g., MRI, PET, SPECT, optical imaging) can potentially track ENM distribution over time, but often lack the required sensitivity (requiring high doses) or spatial resolution, may necessitate specific labeling of the ENMs (which could alter their behavior), and are generally expensive and complex.5</p>
<p>Traditional methods involve sacrificing animals at different time points and measuring ENM content in various tissues and organs, typically using techniques like Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) or Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) for elemental analysis. While sensitive for detecting elements, these methods usually cannot distinguish between intact nanoparticles, aggregated/transformed particles, or dissolved ions/degradation products, limiting the understanding of the form of the material present in the tissue.12 Tracking the translocation of ENMs across critical biological barriers—such as the alveolar epithelium in the lung, the intestinal wall, the blood-brain barrier, or the placenta—is particularly challenging but crucial for understanding systemic exposure and potential toxicity in sensitive organs.7</p>
<p>Furthermore, the development and validation of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, which aim to computationally simulate ENM absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), are hampered by a lack of necessary experimental data for parameterization.5 Specifically, data on ENM transport rates across membranes, dissolution kinetics <em>in vivo</em>, interactions with specific cell types, and clearance mechanisms are often missing for the vast array of existing ENMs. Without reliable internal dosimetry data and predictive models, relating external exposure levels to target organ doses and subsequent health risks remains highly uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Assessing Real-World Exposure Scenarios</strong></p>
<p>Bridging the gap between laboratory studies and real-world human or environmental exposures requires tools and methods capable of measuring ENMs in complex, uncontrolled environments. A significant barrier is the lack of portable, affordable, real-time monitoring instruments that can specifically detect and quantify target ENMs in occupational air or environmental samples, while distinguishing them from the often much higher background of natural and incidental nanoparticles.15 Current occupational exposure assessment often relies on collecting integrated samples (e.g., on filters) for subsequent, time-consuming laboratory analysis, which provides limited information on exposure dynamics or peak concentrations.</p>
<p>Another major challenge lies in characterizing the release of ENMs from consumer products throughout their lifecycle (use, disposal, degradation) and understanding their subsequent fate, transport, and transformation in environmental compartments like soil, water, and air.17 Methods are needed to simulate and measure these processes under realistic conditions. Additionally, most experimental toxicology studies utilize relatively high, acute exposures, whereas real-world exposures are often chronic and at low doses. Developing and validating experimental models that can effectively mimic these realistic, long-term, low-dose scenarios to assess potential cumulative effects remains a difficult but important challenge.12</p>
<p><strong>Section 3: Barriers in Assessing Biological Interactions and Toxicological Endpoints</strong></p>
<p>Understanding the potential hazards of ENMs requires assessing their interactions with biological systems at multiple levels—from molecular interactions (e.g., with DNA, proteins) and cellular responses (e.g., oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis) to effects at the tissue, organ, and whole-organism level.2 However, applying standard toxicological assays, originally developed for soluble chemicals, to particulate ENMs is fraught with difficulties. ENMs can interfere with assay chemistries and detection systems, leading to unreliable results, and may induce toxicity through unique mechanisms not captured by conventional endpoints.13 Developing sensitive, specific, and relevant methods to probe ENM-induced biological effects remains a critical area of need.</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Nanomaterial Interference with Assays</strong></p>
<p>A pervasive problem in <em>in vitro</em> nanotoxicology is the propensity of ENMs to interfere with the assays themselves, leading to false-positive or false-negative results.13 This interference can manifest in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optical Interference:</strong> Many ENMs (e.g., carbon-based materials, metallic nanoparticles) can absorb or scatter light within the wavelengths used by common detection methods like spectrophotometry (e.g., MTT, MTS, WST viability assays), fluorometry (e.g., ROS probes like DCFH-DA, resazurin assays), or luminometry (e.g., ATP-based assays). This can directly confound absorbance, fluorescence, or luminescence readings, leading to inaccurate assessment of cytotoxicity or other endpoints.13</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Interference:</strong> ENMs can adsorb assay reagents (dyes, substrates, antibodies) onto their large surface area, reducing their availability to react or be detected. Conversely, some ENMs possess intrinsic chemical properties, such as catalytic or redox activity, that can directly react with assay components or mimic the biological endpoint being measured. For example, redox-active ENMs can directly oxidize or reduce probes used to measure cellular oxidative stress (ROS), leading to results that do not reflect the actual intracellular redox state.7 ENMs can also denature proteins, potentially interfering with enzyme-based assays (like LDH release) or ELISAs.25</li>
<li><strong>Physical Interference:</strong> ENMs can physically interact with cellular structures or assay components in ways that cause artifacts. For instance, in the comet assay for genotoxicity, dense ENMs might impede DNA migration during electrophoresis, or ENMs might induce DNA damage during sample processing steps rather than through a biological mechanism within the cell.29 Similarly, ENMs could interfere with chromosome visualization or scoring in the micronucleus assay.</li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing these interferences requires meticulous experimental design, including the use of appropriate particle-only controls (in acellular systems) and careful validation of each assay for the specific ENM and conditions being tested.13 This adds significant complexity, time, and cost to <em>in vitro</em> testing and raises fundamental questions about the validity of data generated using unadapted standard protocols. The systemic nature of these interferences challenges the reliability of many existing <em>in vitro</em> datasets and necessitates either laborious assay adaptation or the development of entirely new, interference-resistant measurement platforms.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Sensitivity and Specificity of Current Assays</strong></p>
<p>Beyond interference, many standard toxicological assays may lack the sensitivity required to detect subtle biological perturbations caused by ENMs at low, realistic exposure concentrations.12 Cytotoxicity assays, for example, often require relatively high doses to show significant effects, potentially missing sub-lethal stress responses or adaptive changes occurring at lower concentrations. There is a need for more sensitive methods capable of detecting early molecular initiating events or key events in adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) triggered by ENM exposure.28</p>
<p>Furthermore, many current assays measure rather general endpoints (e.g., overall cell death, total ROS production) and may lack the specificity to elucidate the precise mechanisms of ENM toxicity. Understanding whether toxicity arises from the particle itself, released ions, physical disruption, specific receptor interactions, or other pathways requires more targeted molecular probes and assays. The development and validation of sensitive and specific biomarkers of ENM exposure or effect, applicable across different ENM types and biological systems, remain important goals that are currently unmet.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Limitations in High-Throughput Screening (HTS) / High-Content Analysis (HCA)</strong></p>
<p>Given the vast number and diversity of ENMs being developed, high-throughput screening (HTS) and high-content analysis (HCA) approaches are theoretically attractive for rapidly assessing potential hazards and prioritizing materials for further testing.16 HTS/HCA platforms employ automation, robotics, and miniaturized assays (typically in microplate formats) to test many substances at multiple concentrations simultaneously.29 However, adapting these platforms for reliable ENM testing faces substantial hurdles.26</p>
<p>Maintaining stable, homogenous ENM dispersions during automated liquid handling is challenging, as particles can aggregate or settle in storage containers or assay plates.29 The assay interference issues discussed previously are often exacerbated in HTS formats due to miniaturization and reliance on automated optical readouts.26 Critically, integrating the necessary ENM characterization (e.g., size, aggregation state, dissolution) <em>within the HTS workflow and under assay conditions</em> is technically difficult but essential for interpreting results correctly.26 Validating the biological relevance and predictive capacity of HTS/HCA endpoints for <em>in vivo</em> toxicity also remains a major challenge, requiring comparison with lower-throughput assays and animal studies, which is often lacking.26 Finally, the initial investment and operational complexity of establishing and running robust nano-specific HTS/HCA platforms can be considerable.30 These combined difficulties currently limit the practical utility and reliability of HTS/HCA for comprehensive ENM safety assessment, despite the clear need for such approaches.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Assessing Complex Endpoints (Genotoxicity, Immunotoxicity, Chronic Effects)</strong></p>
<p>Evaluating more complex toxicological endpoints poses additional challenges for ENMs. Standard genotoxicity assays (e.g., Ames bacterial mutation test, <em>in vitro</em> micronucleus test, comet assay) often require adaptation and careful interpretation when applied to ENMs due to potential interference, unique mechanisms of DNA damage (e.g., secondary genotoxicity via inflammation or oxidative stress), and difficulties in ensuring particle delivery to the target genetic material.4 Distinguishing direct genotoxic effects from indirect effects remains difficult.</p>
<p>Assessing immunotoxicity is also complex, as ENMs can interact with various components of the immune system, potentially causing immunosuppression, immunostimulation (including adjuvant effects), or hypersensitivity reactions. The formation of the protein corona plays a critical, yet poorly understood, role in mediating these interactions.4 Developing standardized <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> models that adequately capture the complexity of immune responses to ENMs is an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>Finally, assessing the potential for long-term, chronic health effects resulting from biopersistent ENMs or repeated low-dose exposures is severely limited by the lack of validated methods and models.12 Most nanotoxicology studies focus on acute or sub-acute exposures and may miss delayed or cumulative effects. Similarly, assessing effects on potentially sensitive subpopulations (e.g., individuals with pre-existing conditions) or during critical windows of development (e.g., prenatal exposure 27) requires specialized models and approaches that are not yet widely established or validated for ENMs.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4: Barriers in Methodological Standardization and Predictive Models</strong></p>
<p>Progress in nanotoxicology safety assessment is significantly hampered by a lack of standardization across methods, protocols, and reporting practices. This deficiency leads to poor data comparability and reproducibility, hinders regulatory acceptance of generated data, and impedes the development of reliable predictive models needed to manage the ever-increasing number of novel ENMs.1 Concurrently, while advanced <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in silico</em> models offer promise for reducing reliance on animal testing and improving predictive capabilities, their development, validation, and application for ENMs face specific technical hurdles.</p>
<p><strong>4.1 Lack of Standardized Protocols and Methods</strong></p>
<p>Despite years of research, a major barrier remains the absence of widely accepted, formally validated standard operating procedures (SOPs) for many critical aspects of nanotoxicology testing.4 This includes protocols for ENM dispersion, characterization in relevant media, dosimetry determination, conducting specific <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> toxicity assays (accounting for interferences), and data reporting. This lack of standardization contributes significantly to the variability and frequent inconsistencies observed in the nanotoxicology literature.14</p>
<p>Achieving inter-laboratory reproducibility is extremely difficult when labs use different protocols, variations in critical reagents (e.g., cell culture media, dispersion agents), different cell lines or animal strains, or subtly different equipment settings.32 While international organizations like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) are working on developing standardized test guidelines and guidance documents for nanomaterials 33, progress is often slow, struggling to keep pace with the rapid innovation in nanomaterial synthesis and application. Furthermore, validating these standardized methods across the diverse range of ENMs poses a significant challenge.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Scarcity of Reference Materials</strong></p>
<p>Method validation, instrument calibration, quality assurance, and inter-laboratory comparisons rely heavily on the availability of appropriate reference materials (RMs) and certified reference materials (CRMs). However, there is a significant scarcity of well-characterized, stable, and widely accessible RMs/CRMs for many common types of ENMs.17 Developing such materials is challenging due to the difficulty in producing ENMs with highly consistent and stable physicochemical properties (size, shape, surface chemistry, purity) in sufficient quantities.</p>
<p>Moreover, existing RMs often represent pristine, as-synthesized materials, whereas reference materials mimicking ENMs in more relevant states—such as aged ENMs, ENMs dispersed in complex matrices, or ENMs bearing a specific biomolecule corona—are largely unavailable but critically needed for validating methods under realistic conditions. Without adequate RMs/CRMs, ensuring the accuracy and comparability of measurements across different studies and laboratories remains a major obstacle.17</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Challenges in Developing and Validating Advanced <em>In Vitro</em> Models</strong></p>
<p>There is a strong push, driven by ethical considerations (3Rs principle: Replacement, Reduction, Refinement of animal testing) and efficiency needs, to develop more physiologically relevant <em>in vitro</em> models that can better predict <em>in vivo</em> human responses.4 These include 3D cell cultures, co-cultures of different cell types, organoid models, microfluidic organ-on-a-chip systems, and models incorporating biological barriers (e.g., lung, gut, blood-brain barrier).5 While promising, creating and validating these models specifically for nanotoxicology presents unique challenges.</p>
<p>Replicating the complex microenvironment of <em>in vivo</em> tissues—including multicellular architecture, extracellular matrix components, physiological flow conditions, and tissue-specific functions—is inherently difficult.16 Incorporating realistic immune system components, which play a crucial role in responses to ENMs, adds another layer of complexity. For ENM testing, specific challenges arise in achieving controlled and quantifiable delivery of particles to target cells within these complex 3D or microfluidic systems, and in performing <em>in situ</em> characterization of ENMs and cellular responses within these miniaturized, often optically challenging, environments.37 Furthermore, standardized methods for rigorously validating the physiological relevance and predictive capacity of these advanced models for various ENM types and toxicity endpoints are still lacking.4 Overcoming these technical hurdles is essential to realize the potential of advanced <em>in vitro</em> models for improving nanotoxicology assessment and reducing animal use.</p>
<p><strong>4.4 Limitations in Computational Modeling (QSAR, PBPK)</strong></p>
<p>Computational modeling approaches, such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, hold great potential for predicting ENM behavior and toxicity, prioritizing testing, and aiding risk assessment.5 QSAR models attempt to correlate physicochemical properties (descriptors) of ENMs with their biological activity, while PBPK models simulate the ADME processes within an organism. However, the application of these models to ENMs is currently limited by several factors.</p>
<p>Developing robust QSAR models requires large datasets of high-quality, standardized experimental data covering a diverse range of ENMs and endpoints, which are often unavailable.5 Identifying and quantifying the most relevant descriptors for ENMs is also more complex than for traditional chemicals, needing to encompass parameters like size distribution, shape, surface area, surface chemistry, dissolution rate, and potentially corona characteristics.20 For PBPK models, accurately parameterizing the models to capture ENM-specific processes—such as transport across biological barriers, cellular uptake rates, intracellular trafficking, dissolution and transformation kinetics <em>in vivo</em>, and clearance pathways—is a major bottleneck due to insufficient experimental data.5 Computationally modeling the formation of the biomolecule corona and its dynamic influence on ENM fate and interaction is another significant challenge. Effective use of computational toxicology for ENMs requires better integration between model development and targeted experimental data generation to fill critical knowledge gaps and validate model predictions.5</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The comprehensive assessment of engineered nanomaterial safety remains a formidable challenge, significantly impeded by a wide array of tooling, instrumentation, and methodological barriers. This report has detailed approximately 100 such obstacles spanning the critical areas of ENM characterization, dosimetry and exposure quantification, biological effects assessment, and methodological standardization and predictive modeling. The analysis highlights several deeply ingrained, cross-cutting issues: the dynamic and transformative nature of ENMs in biological and environmental systems, which defies static measurement approaches 12; the pervasive interference of ENMs with conventional analytical techniques and toxicological assays 13; the persistent difficulties in establishing relevant dose metrics and measuring the biologically effective dose 11; the significant gap between simplified <em>in vitro</em> models and complex <em>in vivo</em> realities 5; and a critical lack of standardization in protocols, reference materials, and data reporting practices that undermines data quality and comparability.15</p>
<p>Overcoming these multifaceted barriers is paramount for advancing nanotoxicology from a largely descriptive field towards a more predictive and quantitative science. Progress necessitates a concerted, interdisciplinary effort involving materials scientists, chemists, biologists, toxicologists, physicists, engineers, and computational modelers. Targeted investment is required to develop novel analytical technologies capable of <em>in situ</em>, real-time characterization and monitoring in complex matrices. Robust validation of existing and emerging assays, including advanced <em>in vitro</em> models and HTS platforms, is crucial to ensure data reliability and relevance. Furthermore, significant international cooperation and commitment are needed to accelerate the development and adoption of standardized methodologies, reference materials, and harmonized reporting guidelines, thereby building a foundation for robust data integration, predictive modeling, and globally accepted risk assessment frameworks.6</p>
<p>Addressing the technical quandaries outlined in this report is not merely an academic exercise; it is essential for fostering public confidence, enabling responsible innovation in nanotechnology, ensuring regulatory preparedness, and ultimately protecting human health and environmental integrity in the face of rapidly evolving nanoscale materials and applications.1 While challenges remain significant, continued focus on overcoming these instrumentation and methodological limitations will pave the way for a safer and more sustainable nanotechnology future.</p>
